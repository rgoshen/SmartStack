# ADR-007: Environment & Deployment Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-12
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

SmartStack requires a robust deployment architecture that maintains strict environment separation, supports continuous deployment, and ensures security across development, staging, and production environments. As an open source project, we need clear separation between environments to protect production data while enabling efficient development workflows.

## Decision

1. Use single AWS account with IAM-based environment separation
1. Implement three environments: development, staging, production
1. Use OpenTofu with shared modules and environment-specific configs
1. Design CI/CD pipeline with automatic dev deployment and manual production gates
1. Use AWS Parameter Store for secrets management with path-based separation
1. Implement CloudWatch-based monitoring and logging with environment isolation

## Reasons

1. **Simplified Management**

- Single AWS account reduces complexity for MVP
- IAM roles provide sufficient isolation
- Lower operational overhead

2. **Modular Infrastructure**

- Shared OpenTofu modules ensure consistency
- Environment configs (tfvars) maintain separation
- Easy to understand and modify

3. **Safe Deployment Pipeline**

- Automatic deployment to dev speeds development
- Manual gates for production prevent accidents
- Clear promotion path between environments

4. **Cost-Effective Secrets Management**

- Parameter Store is free for basic use
- Path-based separation is clear and secure
- Integrates well with AWS services

5. **Observable System**

- CloudWatch provides integrated monitoring
- Structured logging enables debugging
- Environment separation prevents log confusion

## Implementation Approach

### Infrastructure Organization

1. OpenTofu structure:

```bash
infrastructure/
  modules/
    networking/
    database/
    storage/
    compute/
    ai-services/
  configs/
    dev.tfvars
    staging.tfvars
    prod.tfvars
main.tf
variables.tf
outputs.tf
backend.tf
```

2. State management:

- Separate S3 state files per environment
- State file locking with DynamoDB
- Encrypted state storage

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. GitHub Actions workflow:

- PR: Tests, linting, security checks
- Merge to main: Auto-deploy to dev
- Manual trigger: Deploy to staging
- Manual approval: Deploy to production

2. Deployment steps:

- Build applications
- Run database migrations
- Deploy infrastructure changes
- Deploy application code
- Run smoke tests

### Environment Configuration

1. Resource naming convention:

```bash
smartstack-{env}-{service}
Examples:

- smartstack-dev-api
- smartstack-prod-db
- smartstack-staging-ai-processor
```

2. IAM roles per environment:

- `smartstack-dev-role`
- `smartstack-staging-role`
- `smartstack-prod-role`

### Secrets Management

1. Parameter Store paths:

```bash
/smartstack/dev/db-password
/smartstack/staging/api-key
/smartstack/prod/jwt-secret
```

2. IAM policies restrict access to environment paths
3. OpenTofu manages parameter creation

### Monitoring & Logging

1. CloudWatch Log Groups:

```bash
/aws/lambda/smartstack-dev-_
/aws/lambda/smartstack-staging-_
/aws/lambda/smartstack-prod-\*
```

2. Retention policies:

- Dev: 7 days
- Staging: 14 days
- Production: 30 days

3. Alarms:

- Error rate thresholds
- Lambda duration
- API Gateway 5xx errors

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- Clear environment separation
- Automated deployments improve velocity
- Consistent infrastructure across environments
- Safe production deployment process
- Cost-effective for MVP phase

**Negative**:

- Single AWS account could limit isolation
- Manual production deployments may slow releases
- IAM complexity grows with services

**Mitigation**:

- Document IAM policies clearly
- Plan migration to multi-account if needed
- Automate production deployments after stability

## Notes

This architecture is designed for MVP and early growth phases. As the system scales, consider migrating to AWS Organizations with separate accounts per environment. The modular OpenTofu structure will make this migration straightforward.
