# ADR-005: AI Integration Architecture

**Date**: 2025-05-10
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

SmartStack requires AI capabilities for three core features: task parsing and categorization, due date/priority suggestions, and a client-facing AI assistant. Each use case has different requirements for accuracy, response time, and context needs. We need an architecture that is cost-effective, maintainable, and allows independent evolution of each AI feature.

## Decision

1. Use different AI models optimized for each use case
1. Implement separate AI services for each feature
1. Create a shared Context Service for providing relevant data
1. Use mixed API approach: async for task parsing, sync for client assistant
1. Implement environment-based model configuration
1. Design graceful degradation for all AI failures

## Reasons

1. **Optimized Performance and Cost**

- Different models allow optimization per use case
- Smaller models for simple tasks reduce costs
- Better models for complex tasks ensure quality

2. **Maintainable Architecture**

- Separate services follow single responsibility principle
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Easier testing and debugging

3. **Flexible Context Management**

- Shared Context Service prevents duplication
- Centralized caching and optimization
- Consistent context across AI features

4. **Appropriate Response Patterns**

- Async processing doesn't block users for parsing
- Sync responses provide immediate feedback for client assistant
- Mixed approach optimizes user experience

5. **Risk Mitigation**

- Graceful degradation ensures system remains functional
- Environment-specific models reduce development costs
- Cost controls prevent unexpected expenses

## Implementation Approach

1. Create three AI services:

- TaskParsingAIService
- PrioritySuggestionAIService
- ClientAssistantAIService

2. Implement shared ContextService providing:

- Client and project lists
- Historical task patterns
- User preferences

3. Configure models per environment:

- Development: Claude Haiku / GPT-3.5
- Production: Claude Sonnet / GPT-4

4. Implement cost controls:

- Token limits per request type
- Daily/monthly cost caps
- Usage monitoring and alerts

5. Design failure handling:

- Fallback strategies for each service
- Circuit breakers for repeated failures
- Comprehensive error logging

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- Optimized cost and performance per feature
- Independent evolution of AI capabilities
- Robust error handling and system reliability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Flexible deployment options

**Negative**:

- More services to maintain
- Complex inter-service communication
- Need to manage multiple model configurations
- Potential context synchronization issues

**Mitigation**:

- Use consistent service templates
- Implement comprehensive monitoring
- Document integration patterns clearly
- Regular architecture reviews

## Notes

This architecture prioritizes flexibility and optimization over simplicity. As the system grows, we may need to implement an AI Gateway to manage common concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and logging across all AI services.
