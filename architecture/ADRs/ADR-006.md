# ADR-006: Data Storage Architecture

**Date**: 2025-05-10
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

SmartStack needs to store various types of data including user accounts, tasks, client information, file attachments, and AI processing history. As an open source project, we need strict environment separation to prevent production data from being used in development or testing. We require versioning for tasks, secure file storage, and a clear data retention policy.

## Decision

1. Use PostgreSQL for structured data with separate databases per environment
1. Use S3 for file storage with separate buckets per environment
1. Implement full task versioning with history table pattern
1. Use pre-signed URLs for secure file access
1. Implement 1-year retention policy for deleted projects
1. Create comprehensive file lifecycle management

## Reasons

1. **Environment Isolation**

- Separate databases prevent accidental cross-environment access
- Separate S3 buckets ensure file isolation
- Critical for open source project security

1. **Versioning Strategy**

- History table pattern is well-understood and maintainable
- Preserves current state performance
- Enables complete audit trail

1. **Security First**

- Private S3 files with pre-signed URLs prevent unauthorized access
- Time-limited access reduces exposure
- Traceable file access patterns

1. **Data Retention**

- 1-year retention provides legal protection
- Glacier storage reduces costs for archived data
- Clear lifecycle prevents accumulation of orphaned data

## Implementation Approach

### PostgreSQL Structure

1. Create separate databases:

- smartstack_dev
- smartstack_staging
- smartstack_prod

1. Core tables with history pattern:

```sql
tasks (current state only)
tasks_history (all versions)
clients
projects
users
files
```

3. File reference tracking:

```sql
files (
  id,
  s3_key,
  s3_bucket,
  file_size,
  mime_type,
  checksum,
  uploaded_at,
  uploaded_by,
  status,
  associated_entity_type,
  associated_entity_id
)
```

### S3 Organization

1. Bucket structure per environment:

```bash
smartstack-{environment}/
  users/{user_id}/
    tasks/{task_id}/
      attachments/
    profile/
  ai-logs/
  backups/
  quarantine/
  temp/
```

2. Lifecycle rules:

- Transition to Glacier after 90 days inactive
- Delete from quarantine/ after 30 days
- Delete from temp/ after 7 days

### Data Lifecycle

1. Task versioning:

- Copy to history table on every update
- Maintain version number and timestamps
- Track user who made changes

2. File lifecycle:

- Active → Archived (90 days) → Marked for deletion → Deleted (1 year)
- Soft delete with quarantine period
- Orphan detection and cleanup

3. Access patterns:

- Pre-signed URLs with varied expiration
- Private files by default
- Audit trail for file access

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- Complete environment isolation
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Secure file handling
- Cost-effective archival strategy
- Legal compliance for data retention
- Clear data lifecycle management

**Negative**:

- More complex than single database
- Higher initial setup cost
- Need to manage multiple environments
- Complex file lifecycle logic

**Mitigation**:

Automate environment provisioning with OpenTofu
Create clear operational procedures
Implement comprehensive monitoring
Regular testing of lifecycle rules

## Notes

Future considerations include implementing database connection pooling, caching strategies for frequently accessed data, and potential migration to multi-region storage for disaster recovery. The 1-year retention policy should be reviewed annually for compliance with emerging regulations.
