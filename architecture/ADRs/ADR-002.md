# ADR-002: Real-time Status Updates

**Date**: 2025-01-09
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

Frontend needs to show real-time updates of AI task processing status. Users expect immediate feedback when tasks are being processed and when they complete or fail. This improves user experience and reduces support requests about task status.

## Decision

Implement WebSocket connections for real-time status updates to the frontend.

## Reasons

1. **User Experience**

Immediate feedback reduces user anxiety
No need for manual page refreshes
Clear visibility of system activity

2. **Reduced Server Load**

More efficient than polling endpoints
Only sends updates when status changes
Scales better than constant API requests

3. **Foundation for Future Features**

Can extend to other real-time features
Supports collaborative features later
Enables push notifications

## Implementation Approach

Establish WebSocket connection on frontend load
Subscribe to task-specific channels
Backend publishes status updates to relevant channels
Frontend updates UI components reactively
Implement reconnection logic for connection drops

## Consequences

**Positive**:

Better user experience with immediate feedback
Reduced API load from polling
Foundation for real-time features
Modern, responsive interface

**Negative**:

Additional complexity in frontend and backend
Need to manage WebSocket connections
Requires connection state handling

**Mitigation**:

Use established WebSocket library (Socket.io)
Implement proper error handling and reconnection
Graceful fallback to polling if needed
