# ADR-004: WebSocket Implementation for Real-time Updates

**Date**: 2025-05-10
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

SmartStack requires real-time updates for task processing status notifications. The frontend needs immediate feedback when AI processes tasks, and users need real-time alerts for tasks requiring manual review. We evaluated three approaches: Native WebSocket, Socket.io, and AWS API Gateway WebSocket.

## Decision

We will use Socket.io for WebSocket implementation with an adapter pattern for future flexibility.
Reasons

## Reasons

1. Fast MVP Development

- Built-in reconnection logic and fallback mechanisms
- Extensive documentation and examples for Nest.js integration
- Out-of-the-box features reduce development time

2. Framework Compatibility

- Native support in Nest.js via @WebSocketGateway
- Well-established patterns for Next.js client integration
- Strong TypeScript support

3. Reliability Features

- Automatic reconnection handling
- Multiple transport fallbacks
- Built-in heartbeat mechanism
- Room/namespace support for organizing connections

4. Scalability Path

- Can start with in-memory adapter for MVP
- Redis adapter available for horizontal scaling
- Cluster support when needed

5. Abstraction Strategy

- Implement adapter pattern to abstract Socket.io specifics
- Enables future migration to different solutions if needed
- Aligns with our storage-agnostic architecture principles

## Implementation Approach

- Create WebSocket adapter interface in the domain layer
- Implement Socket.io adapter in infrastructure layer
- Use Nest.js WebSocket Gateway for connection management
- Implement event types for:
  - Task status updates
  - Client notifications
  - Manual review alerts

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Faster MVP delivery
- Robust connection handling out-of-the-box
- Simplified client-side implementation
- Clear upgrade path for scaling
- Strong community support and documentation

**Negative**

- Additional dependency in the stack
- Not AWS-native (requires EC2/ECS for scaling)
- Slightly higher bandwidth usage than raw WebSocket
- Learning curve for Socket.io specific concepts

**Mitigation**

- Adapter pattern allows future replacement
- Can migrate to AWS-native solution post-MVP if needed
- Socket.io overhead is negligible for our use case

- [ADR-003: Manual Review Handling](./ADR-003.md)

## Notes

This decision prioritizes MVP speed while maintaining architectural flexibility through the adapter pattern, consistent with our approach to storage and queue implementations.
