# ADR-003: Manual Review Handling

**Date**: 2025-05-10
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

Some tasks will fail AI processing even after retry attempts. These tasks need human intervention to resolve issues or provide additional context. The system must gracefully handle these edge cases and provide clear workflows for manual resolution.

## Decision

Implement comprehensive manual review system for tasks that fail automated processing.

## Reasons

1. **Graceful Degradation**

- System remains functional even when AI fails
- Users maintain control over their data
- Prevents task loss or blocking

2. **User Empowerment**

- Users can resolve issues themselves
- Reduces dependency on support team
- Maintains user confidence in system

3. **Learning Opportunity**

- Failed tasks provide insights for improvement
- Can identify patterns in failures
- Helps refine AI processing logic

## Implementation Approach

- Mark failed tasks with NEEDS_REVIEW status
- Create dedicated UI section for review queue
- Send notifications for tasks needing attention
- Allow manual re-trigger of AI processing
- Provide manual override for task categorization
- Log review actions for analysis

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- System remains usable during AI failures
- Users have control over edge cases
- Provides feedback loop for system improvement
- Reduces support burden

**Negative**:

- Requires additional UI development
- Users must handle some tasks manually
- May reveal AI limitations to users

**Mitigation**:

- Make review interface intuitive and efficient
- Provide context about why processing failed
- Use review data to improve AI processing

## Notes

This system serves as both a safety net and a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement of the AI processing capabilities.
