# ADR-008: Authentication & Authorization

**Date**: 2025-05-10
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

SmartStack requires a secure authentication system that supports three user types: freelancers (primary users), administrators (system management), and clients (limited access for AI assistant). The system needs to balance security with usability, especially for client access where we want minimal friction. As an open source project with multi-tenant data, security is paramount.

## Decision

1. Implement JWT-based authentication with different strategies per user type
1. Use httpOnly cookies for secure token storage with hybrid token approach
1. Implement Google Drive-style share links for client access (no login required)
1. Support email/password and GitHub OAuth for freelancers
1. Require enhanced security for administrators
1. Use row-level security for multi-tenant data isolation

## Reasons

1. **Security First Approach**

- httpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
- Short-lived access tokens minimize exposure
- Refresh tokens allow secure session extension

2. **User Experience**

- Clients don't need accounts (reduces friction)
- Share links are familiar pattern (like Google Drive)
- Social login options for freelancers

3. **Flexible Access Control**

- Different token types per user role
- Granular permissions in tokens
- Revocable client access

4. **Maintainable Security**

- Standard JWT pattern
- Clear separation of concerns
- Audit trail capabilities

## Implementation Approach

### Token Strategy

1. **Freelancer/Admin Authentication:**

```bash
Access Token (15 min) → Stored in memory
Refresh Token (7 days) → httpOnly cookie
```

2. **Client Access:**

```bash
Share Link → Contains encrypted token
Session Cookie → Set after first visit (24h)
```

### Token Structures

1. **Freelancer JWT:**

```json
{
  "sub": "user_id",
  "type": "freelancer",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

2. **Client Access Token:**

```json
{
  "sub": "client_id",
  "type": "client",
  "freelancer_id": "owner_id",
  "project_id": "project_id",
  "permissions": ["read_project", "use_ai_assistant"],
  "exp": 1234567890 // optional
}
```

3. Admin JWT:

```json
{
  "sub": "admin_id",
  "type": "admin",
  "permissions": ["all"],
  "require_2fa": true,
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

### Security Measures

1. **Password Requirements:**

- Minimum 12 characters
- Complexity requirements
- Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds = 12

2. **Rate Limiting:**

- 5 failed attempts = 15-minute lockout
- Progressive backoff for repeated violations

3. **Two-Factor Authentication:**

- Optional for freelancers (email/password auth)
- Mandatory for administrators
- TOTP-based implementation

4. **Session Management:**

- Track active sessions
- Ability to revoke sessions
- Audit trail of authentication events

### Share Link Management

1. Database Schema:

```sql
share_links (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  freelancer_id UUID NOT NULL,
  client_id UUID,
  project_id UUID,
  token_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  permissions JSONB,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  revoked_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  last_accessed_at TIMESTAMP,
  access_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
)
```

2. Link Features:

- Optional expiration dates
- Revocation without breaking other links
- Usage analytics and tracking
- Multiple links per project allowed

### Multi-tenant Security

1. **Row-Level Security:**

- All queries filtered by user_id/freelancer_id
- Database-level RLS policies
- Application-level enforcement

2. **Data Isolation:**

- Clients only see their project data
- Freelancers only see their workspace
- No cross-tenant data leakage

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- Strong security against common attacks (XSS, CSRF)
- Flexible access control per user type
- Frictionless client experience
- Comprehensive audit capabilities
- Scalable permission system

**Negative**:

- Complex token management
- Additional infrastructure for refresh tokens
- Share link management overhead
- Memory storage requirement for access tokens

**Mitigation**:

- Use established libraries (jose, passport.js)
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Regular security audits
- Clear documentation for token flows

## Notes

Future considerations include implementing OAuth providers beyond GitHub, hardware token support for high-security accounts, and potential migration to WebAuthn for passwordless authentication. The share link system could be extended to support granular permissions and collaborative features.
