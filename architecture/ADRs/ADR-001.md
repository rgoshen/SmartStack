# ADR-001: Task Processing Architecture

**Date**: 2025-05-10
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

SmartStack needs to process tasks from multiple sources (manual entry, email, external integrations) in a unified way. Tasks require AI processing which may fail and need retry logic. The system must track processing status and handle failures gracefully. Business logic should be source-agnostic and storage-agnostic.

## Decision

Implement an asynchronous task processing architecture with message queue pattern and adapter abstractions.

## Reasons

1. **Separation of Concerns**

- Business logic remains independent of input sources
- Storage implementation can be changed without affecting core logic
- Follows dependency inversion principle

2. **Resilience and Reliability**

- Async processing prevents blocking on AI operations
- Retry mechanism handles transient failures
- Manual intervention path for persistent failures

3. **Scalability**

- Queue-based processing can scale independently
- Supports future growth in task volume
- Allows adding new input sources easily

## Implementation Approach

- Create Task domain model with processing status tracking
- Define TaskRepository interface for storage abstraction
- Implement message queue with AWS SQS behind adapter interface
- Track AI processing states: PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED/FAILED/NEEDS_REVIEW
- Set maximum retry attempts to 3 before manual intervention

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- Resilient to processing failures
- Can scale processing independently
- Storage and queue implementations can be swapped
- Clear separation of concerns

**Negative**:

- Additional complexity with async processing
- Requires message queue infrastructure
- More moving parts to monitor

**Mitigation**:

- Start with simple SQS implementation
- Use adapter pattern for future flexibility
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Notes

This architecture supports the MVP goal of unifying task management while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
