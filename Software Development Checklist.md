# ✅ Software Development Checklist
*(For both professional & personal projects)*  
- **🟢 = Required for both professional & personal apps**  
- **🟠 = Important for professional apps but optional for personal use**  
- **🔴 = Only necessary for professional applications**  

---

## 1️⃣ Define the Purpose & Requirements
- 🟢 Identify the core problem the app solves  
- 🟢 List the key features and functionalities  
- 🟢 Choose target platform (Web, Desktop, Mobile, CLI)  
- 🟠 Define non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)  
- 🔴 Gather detailed stakeholder feedback & business goals  
- 🔴 Define regulatory & compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)  

---

## 2️⃣ Research & Feasibility
- 🟢 Check if existing solutions meet your needs  
- 🟢 Identify required technologies (programming language, framework, database)  
- 🟠 Check hardware & software constraints (if applicable)  
- 🔴 Perform a cost-benefit analysis  
- 🔴 Identify project risks & mitigation strategies  

---

## 3️⃣ System Architecture & Design
- 🟢 Choose software architecture (Monolith, MVC, Microservices, etc.)  
- 🟢 Define key components (Frontend, Backend, Database, APIs)  
- 🟢 Decide where data will be stored (File system, Database, Cloud, Local)  
- 🟠 Design database schema or data model (ERD, UML diagrams)  
- 🔴 Define scaling strategy (Horizontal, Vertical Scaling)  
- 🔴 Design system for high availability & disaster recovery  

---

## 4️⃣ UI/UX Design
- 🟢 Create basic wireframes or UI sketches  
- 🟢 Plan navigation & user interactions  
- 🟠 Choose UI framework (Material UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Swift, JavaFX, etc.)  
- 🔴 Conduct UX research (user surveys, A/B testing)  
- 🔴 Develop high-fidelity prototypes  

---

## 5️⃣ Choose Tech Stack & Tools
- 🟢 Pick a programming language (Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.)  
- 🟢 Choose a framework/library (Spring Boot, React, Flask, .NET, etc.)  
- 🟢 Select a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Firebase, etc.)  
- 🟠 Use version control (Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)  
- 🔴 Define DevOps strategy (CI/CD, containerization with Docker/Kubernetes)  
- 🔴 Select logging & monitoring tools (New Relic, Datadog, ELK)  

---

## 6️⃣ API & Integration Strategy
- 🟢 Decide API approach (REST, GraphQL, WebSockets)  
- 🟠 Choose authentication method (JWT, OAuth, API Keys)  
- 🔴 Document APIs using OpenAPI (Swagger)  
- 🔴 Plan third-party integrations (Payment gateways, analytics, notifications)  

---

## 7️⃣ Security Measures
- 🟠 Validate user inputs to prevent SQL Injection/XSS attacks  
- 🟠 Use HTTPS for encrypted communication  
- 🟠 Store passwords securely (bcrypt, Argon2)  
- 🔴 Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- 🔴 Perform security audits & penetration testing  
- 🔴 Set up DDoS protection & rate limiting  

---

## 8️⃣ Development
- 🟢 Set up the development environment (IDE, dependencies, virtual environment)  
- 🟢 Follow best practices (Clean Code, SOLID principles, DRY, KISS)  
- 🟠 Write modular & maintainable code  
- 🟠 Implement logging for debugging  
- 🔴 Use feature flags & versioning for releases  

---

## 9️⃣ Testing
- 🟠 Manually test key features  
- 🟠 Write unit tests (JUnit, pytest, Jest, etc.)  
- 🔴 Perform integration tests  
- 🔴 Conduct automated end-to-end (E2E) tests  
- 🔴 Do performance & load testing  

---

## 🔟 Deployment
- 🟢 For personal apps: Run locally or deploy to a basic cloud service  
- 🟠 Use a simple cloud hosting solution (Vercel, Firebase, Netlify, etc.)  
- 🔴 Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)  
- 🔴 Deploy in environments (Dev → Staging → Production)  

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Monitoring & Maintenance
- 🟢 Fix bugs as they appear  
- 🟠 Track performance metrics (response time, database queries)  
- 🔴 Implement error reporting (Sentry, Rollbar)  
- 🔴 Set up automated health checks & alerts  

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Iteration & Improvement
- 🟢 Collect personal feedback on usability  
- 🟠 Optimize performance & improve features over time  
- 🔴 Conduct user feedback sessions & update roadmap
