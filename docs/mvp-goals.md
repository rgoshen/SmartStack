# üéØ SmartStack MVP Goals

This document outlines the updated goals for the SmartStack Minimum Viable Product (MVP). These goals guide development and ensure the MVP delivers real user value with the smallest usable scope.

## ‚úÖ MVP Objective

> Help freelance developers **stay on top of client work** by capturing tasks in one place, organizing project context, and enabling smooth communication‚Äîwith AI assisting both the developer and their clients.

---

## üîç Core MVP Goals

### 1. **Unified Task Capture**

- Users can input tasks manually
- Forward tasks from email
- Connect to Trello or Google Sheets (light integration or stub)

### 2. **AI-Powered Task Organization**

- Group tasks by project or client
- Infer and assign due dates
- Assign priority level (basic: High, Medium, Low)
- Flag tasks that are unclear or need user review

### 3. **Smart Taskboard**

- Central view of all tasks
- Filter/sort by project, due date, priority
- Users can edit, complete, or mark tasks as ‚ÄúNeeds Clarification‚Äù

### 4. **Client Communication Tracking**

- Each task may include client-facing notes or follow-up reminders
- System tracks last interaction date per client
- Users can view recent touchpoints and overdue follow-ups
- Daily nudges include comms reminders (e.g. "No contact with Client X in 10 days")

### 5. **Project Context & Client Profiles**

- View all tasks grouped under each client
- Lightweight ‚ÄúClient Profile‚Äù page:
  - Name, email/contact
  - Linked tasks
  - Notes field
- Add/edit client info directly in UI

### 6. **Client-Facing AI Assistant (Basic)**

- Clients can ask the AI assistant questions (e.g. ‚ÄúWhen‚Äôs my next deliverable?‚Äù)
- AI pulls from task/project metadata
- Hosted on a separate public-facing widget or portal (stub if needed for MVP)

### 7. **Notifications & Nudges**

- Daily digest of:
  - Upcoming tasks
  - Overdue tasks
  - Tasks needing review
  - Comms nudges (e.g. ‚ÄúNo update sent to Client Z this week‚Äù)
- Alert on login
- Optional notification settings

### 8. **Persistence**

- Tasks and client data saved and linked to user account
- State persists across sessions
- Enable task and client info updates and deletion
