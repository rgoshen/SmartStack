# 🛠️ SmartStack Development Guide

A step-by-step roadmap for building the **SmartStack** product—from idea to MVP launch. Use this guide to work independently and track progress.

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Define the Product Vision
- Capture the **core purpose** of the product.
- Who is it for?
- What problem does it solve?
- What is unique or differentiated?

📌 **Save to:** `docs/product-vision.md`

---

### 2. Identify Target User Types (Personas)
- Create 2–3 user profiles
- Include:
  - User type (full-time, part-time, team lead, etc.)
  - Tools they use today
  - Pain points
  - What they want from a better solution

📌 **Save to:** `docs/user-personas.md`

---

### 3. Clarify Core Problems
- List the 3–5 key overlapping issues users face.
- Use short explanations for each.

📌 **Save to:** `docs/core-problems.md`

---

### 4. Define Key Outcomes & MVP Goals
- What does success look like?
- What can we deliver quickly that still provides real value?
- Focus on learning and validating early.

📌 **Save to:** `docs/mvp-goals.md`

---

### 5. Map High-Level User Flows
- Visualize or describe what users do step-by-step in the product.
- Focus on the primary journey: onboarding → using core features.

📌 **Save to:** `docs/user-flows.md`

---

### 6. Identify MVP Features
- Choose the smallest feature set that solves one key user problem end-to-end.
- Prioritize based on value vs effort.

📌 **Save to:** `docs/features-mvp.md`

---

### 7. Design Architecture
- Decide on tech stack (frontend, backend, storage, AI integration).
- Choose between monolith vs microservices (start simple!).
- Identify key services and components.

📌 **Save to:** `architecture/high-level-overview.md`

---

### 8. Break Down Epics & User Stories
- Translate goals and features into stories.
- Organize by epics (e.g. onboarding, task management, AI assistant).

📌 **Save to:** `product/backlog.md`

---

### 9. Set Up Development Environment
- Initialize repo, branches
- Set up local tooling, linters, CI/CD

📌 **Save to:** `README.md` + `docs/dev-setup.md`

---

### 10. Build in Thin Vertical Slices
- Build a complete slice from frontend → backend → DB → UI for each story.
- Deploy frequently.
- Test early and often (TDD if possible).

📌 **Track progress in:** `kanban-board.md` or use tools like Jira/Trello

---

### 11. Collect Feedback & Iterate
- Launch to early testers or pilot users.
- Capture feedback.
- Use what you learn to refine features, flows, and priorities.

📌 **Save to:** `docs/user-feedback.md`
