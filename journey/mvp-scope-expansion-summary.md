# 🚀 SmartStack MVP Scope Expansion – Summary & Next Steps
**Date:** April 05, 2025

This document captures the expanded MVP goals, updated features, and user flows for the SmartStack project. It reflects the decisions made to better align the MVP with the core problems we originally identified—especially around client communication and project context.

---

## ✅ What We Covered

### 🔍 Core Problem Alignment
We revisited the **core problems** and found that the original MVP only addressed Task Management fully. We expanded the MVP to also tackle:

- **Client Communication**
- **Project Context**
- **Client-Facing AI Support**

---

## 🎯 Updated MVP Goals (`mvp-goals.md`)
We added three new goal areas:

1. **Client Communication Tracking**
2. **Project Context & Client Profiles**
3. **Client-Facing AI Assistant (Basic)**

We also added **Success Metrics**, including adoption, task usage, AI acceptance, and comms tracking.

---

## 🧩 Updated MVP Features (`features-mvp.md`)
New features added:

- 🧾 Client Communication Tracking  
- 🗂️ Lightweight Client Profiles  
- 🤖 Client-Facing AI Assistant  

Also included:  
- Updated Feature-to-Goal Mapping table

---

## 🧭 Updated User Flows (`user-flows.md`)
Added two new flows:

- `6. Client Communication & Profile Flow`
- `7. Client-Facing AI Assistant Flow`

Existing flows updated to reflect nudges for communication tracking.

---

## 📌 Next Steps

1. ✅ MVP design goals, features, and flows are now aligned
2. 🧱 **Next: Begin Architecture Design**
   - Define system components (frontend, backend, AI layer, database)
   - Decide monolith vs services
   - Sketch key modules (auth, task parsing, AI endpoints, client-facing widget)
3. 🎨 Create or update `architecture/high-level-overview.md`
4. 🔁 Translate features into **Epics & Stories** (`product/backlog.md`)
5. 🔨 Set up project structure + dev environment

---

## 📂 Files Affected
- `docs/mvp-goals.md`
- `docs/features-mvp.md`
- `docs/user-flows.md`

Keep this summary with your project notes so you can easily resume the conversation when you move into architecture or backlog planning.

You've got a rock-solid foundation now. Let’s build it. 💪
