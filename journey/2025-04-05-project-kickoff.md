## 😰 Core Problems

### 1. Task Management

Tasks are spread across tools and clients, leading to inconsistent priorities and things falling through the cracks.

### 2. Client Communication

Follow-ups and messages are often missed due to inbox clutter and tool sprawl.

### 3. Organization

Decisions and documentation are rarely updated or centralized—causing wasted time and loss of context.

### 4. Context Switching & Cognitive Load

Jumping between tools and clients drains mental energy and creates errors or delays.

## ✅ Next Steps

Here’s what we’ll tackle next, step-by-step:

1. **Define Key Outcomes & MVP Goals**

   - What measurable success looks like
   - What a “small but powerful” first version could deliver

2. **Sketch the User Flows**

   - From onboarding to daily use: what is the journey like for Sam, Min, and Tim?

3. **Identify MVP Features**

   - Which problems do we solve _first_ to deliver real value?

4. **Outline High-Level Architecture**

   - Frontend/backend shape, AI integration points, core services, and tech stack

5. **Break into Epics & Thin Slices**
   - Translate problems into stories, starting with the simplest, most valuable slices

Let’s keep building—one thoughtful step at a time. 💪
