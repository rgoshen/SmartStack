## 2025-04-05 – Architecture Finalization + Learning Workflow

### ✅ What I Worked On
- Feature/Task: Finalized SmartStack high-level architecture
- Area of the stack: Full stack (frontend, backend, infra, AI)
- Related files or modules:
  - `architecture/high-level-overview.md`
  - `smartstack-architecture-summary.md`
  - `mvp-scope-expansion-summary.md`
  - `mvp-snapshot.md`

### 🤔 What I Learned
- How to rationalize each architecture decision clearly (e.g., why Next.js, Nest.js, AWS, OpenTofu).
- The difference between OpenTofu `*.tfvars` and `workspaces` and why `tfvars` is better for this project.
- Why it's important to separate CI/CD workflows (PR checks vs deploys).
- How much clarity can come from clean, well-structured Markdown docs.
- That managing your own project like a real product improves decision-making.

### 🐛 What I Got Stuck On
- I had a brief moment of mismatch in expectations—wanting a collaborative, step-by-step mentor style but feeling like I was being rushed ahead. I paused and corrected course.
- Not sure what the best tooling would be for project management since I’m building a PM system myself.
- Some questions around how best to track daily progress (Trello? Notion? Markdown?).

### 🔎 How I Solved It (or Plan To)
- Re-centered the pace by insisting on finishing the architecture doc before moving on.
- Asked about tooling, then reviewed trade-offs of Trello vs Notion vs Markdown vs Ultimate Brain (PARA).
- Started a Markdown journal to capture daily learning (this file).

### 💭 Notes & Reflections
- I enjoyed today’s session—it clarified a lot and gave me confidence in the foundation of SmartStack.
- I love that this is becoming a reflection of both my engineering growth and my product thinking.
- I want to keep tracking decisions, questions, and learning like this—and maybe turn it into a blog series later.
