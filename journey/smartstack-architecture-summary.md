# âœ… SmartStack Architecture: Summary & Next Steps

This file captures what we've covered so far, and outlines the next logical steps to continue building the project with clarity and purpose.

---

## âœ… What We've Covered

### 1. **Product Goals & MVP Scope**
- Captured core user flows and features.
- Prioritized a clear MVP with focus on AI-assisted task and client communication.

### 2. **High-Level Architecture Design**
- Frontend: **Next.js** for flexibility, performance, and learning goals.
- Backend: **Nest.js** for structured APIs and TypeScript consistency.
- Cloud: **AWS** for full-stack cloud infrastructure and skill development.
- AI Integration: **Amazon Bedrock** via Lambda proxy.
- Infrastructure as Code: **OpenTofu**, Terraform-compatible, open-source.
- Database: **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** for structured relational data.
- File Storage: **S3** for storing files, transcripts, and prompt logs.
- Hosting: **S3 + CloudFront** selected over Amplify/Vercel for cost control and flexibility.

### 3. **Environment Strategy**
- Environments: **Test â†’ Staging â†’ Production**.
- Managed using **OpenTofu with `*.tfvars` files** for clarity and automation.
- Each environment has isolated infrastructure (RDS, S3, Lambdas, etc.).

### 4. **Architecture Rationale**
- Added detailed explanations for each tech choice (Next.js, Nest.js, AWS, OpenTofu, Env Strategy).
- Rooted decisions in both learning goals and production-readiness.

### 5. **System Diagram**
- Mermaid diagram included in the architecture doc.
- Visually maps frontend, backend, services, and infrastructure.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

### 1. **Infrastructure Setup with OpenTofu**
- Define base `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and environment-specific `*.tfvars` files.
- Start with S3 + CloudFront + Route 53 (frontend hosting).
- Build out additional modules for RDS, API Gateway, Lambda.

### 2. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
- Create `pr-checks.yml`:
  - Run tests, lint, and Sourcery on every PR.
- Create `deploy.yml`:
  - Build frontend/backend, deploy to AWS, apply OpenTofu.

### 3. **Backend API Design**
- Define REST endpoints in Nest for:
  - Auth (JWT)
  - Tasks
  - Client communications
  - AI proxy
- Organize modules and DTOs for clean domain boundaries.

### 4. **Frontend Integration Plan**
- Build with `next export` initially (for static hosting).
- Connect to backend using `fetch`/Axios/SWR.
- Create basic UI components for tasks and client chat.

### 5. **First Thin Vertical Slice**
- Choose one feature (e.g., "create and list tasks").
- Build end-to-end: UI â†’ API â†’ DB â†’ confirmation.
- Deploy to test or staging.
