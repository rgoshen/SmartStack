## ✅ Step 4: Key Outcomes & MVP Goals

### 🎯 Key Outcomes
SmartStack will help freelance developers:
- Stay on top of their client tasks—even across multiple tools and inboxes.
- Reduce mental overhead by organizing and surfacing the most important actions.
- Avoid dropped balls with smart reminders and nudges.
- Feel more in control and less reactive in their daily workflow.

---

### 🛠️ MVP Goal
> Build a thin slice of “Task Intelligence” that:
- Lets users **capture** tasks easily (from email, manual input, or integrations).
- Uses **AI to organize** those tasks (by project, due date, and priority).
- Sends helpful **notifications or nudges** (e.g. daily digest or follow-up reminders).

---

## ✅ Step 5: High-Level User Flows

### 🧭 Core User Flow: Capture & Stay on Top of Tasks

1. **User logs in** (auth step).
2. **Inputs tasks** via:
   - Manual entry
   - Email forwarding / parsing
   - Tool integrations (e.g., Trello, Sheets)
3. **AI organizes tasks** by:
   - Project/client
   - Due date (inferred or manual)
   - Priority
   - Flags tasks that are unclear
4. **User reviews & edits tasks** on the Smart Taskboard:
   - Mark complete, edit details, or flag as “Needs Clarification”
5. **User receives smart nudges**:
   - Daily digest
   - Reminder to review flagged or due tasks

## ✅ Step 6: Identified MVP Features

| Feature Area | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Auth** | Login/signup (email + password) |
| **Task Ingestion** | Manual entry, email input, basic Trello/Sheets integration |
| **AI Parsing** | Organize by client/project, infer due dates, flag unclear tasks |
| **Taskboard UI** | Edit tasks, filter/sort, flag "Needs Clarification" |
| **Notifications** | Daily digest, reminders for due/unclear tasks |
| **Persistence** | Task data saved per user |

---

## ⏳ Deferred Features (For Later)
- Comment threads or task discussions
- Smart action suggestions (e.g. “Send a follow-up email?”)
- Slack/Asana/Voice/Mobile integrations

---

## ▶️ Next Steps

1. **Step 7: Design Architecture**
   - Choose tech stack (frontend, backend, storage, AI service)
   - Design the overall system layout (start with monolith or modular?)
   - Determine how AI will be integrated (OpenAI, LangChain, custom NLP)

2. **Step 8: Break Down Epics & User Stories**
   - Translate features and flows into detailed user stories
   - Group by epic (e.g. "Task Capture", "AI Org", "Taskboard")

3. **Step 9: Set Up Dev Environment**
   - Initialize project repo
   - Choose dev tools, formatter, CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions)
