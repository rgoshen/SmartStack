## What We Accomplished

### 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Created a complete set of 9 ADRs documenting all major architectural decisions:

1. **ADR-001: Task Processing Architecture**

- Asynchronous processing with message queues
- Adapter pattern for storage/queue abstraction
- Retry mechanism with manual intervention fallback

2. **ADR-002: Real-time Status Updates**

- WebSocket implementation for live updates
- Improves user experience with immediate feedback

3. **ADR-003: Manual Review Handling**

- Graceful degradation when AI fails
- User empowerment through manual controls
- Feedback loop for system improvement

4. **ADR-004: WebSocket Implementation**

- Socket.io chosen for rapid MVP development
- Adapter pattern for future flexibility
- Excellent framework compatibility

5. **ADR-005: AI Integration Architecture**

- Different AI models for different use cases
- Separate AI services for modularity
- Shared context service
- Mixed sync/async API approach

6. **ADR-006: Data Storage Architecture**

- PostgreSQL for structured data
- S3 for file storage
- Strict environment separation
- Full task versioning with history tables
- 1-year retention for deleted projects

7. **ADR-007: Environment & Deployment Architecture**

- Single AWS account with IAM separation
- Three environments: dev, staging, production
- OpenTofu with tfvars for infrastructure as code
- CloudWatch monitoring and logging

8. **ADR-008: Authentication & Authorization**

- JWT-based authentication
- httpOnly cookies with refresh tokens
- Google Drive-style share links for clients
- Row-level security for multi-tenancy

9. **ADR-009: API Design**

- REST with mixed endpoint structure
- URL path versioning
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Standardized response formats

### 2. Standardized ADR Template

Created a comprehensive ADR template with sections for:

- Context
- Decision
- Reasons
- Implementation Approach
- Consequences (Positive/Negative)
- Mitigation strategies
- Related decisions
- Notes

### 3. C4 Architecture Diagrams

Created multiple levels of C4 diagrams using Mermaid:

1. **System Context Diagram (Level 1)**

- Shows SmartStack's place in the world
- Three user types: Freelancers, Clients, Administrators
- External systems: Email, Bedrock, S3, OAuth

2. **Container Diagram (Level 2)**

- Web Application (Next.js)
- API Application (Nest.js/Lambda)
- AI Service (Nest.js/Lambda)
- Database (PostgreSQL/RDS)
- File Storage (S3)
- Task Queue (SQS)

3. **Component Diagram - API Application (Level 3)**

- Modular structure with controllers and services
- Auth, Task, Client, Project modules
- Clean separation of concerns

4. **Component Diagram - AI Service (Level 3)**

- Different services for different AI tasks
- Centralized prompt management
- Context service for data retrieval

5. **Deployment Diagram**

- AWS infrastructure layout
- VPC with public/private subnets
- CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda functions
- RDS Multi-AZ, S3 buckets
- Security layers with Secrets Manager

### 4. Documentation Standards

- Created C4 diagram template for consistency
- Established documentation tracking system
- Set up planned documentation tracker for future work

### 5. Key Technical Decisions Made

- **Frontend**: Next.js (for learning and modern React features)
- **Backend**: Nest.js (for TypeScript consistency and modularity)
- **Cloud**: AWS (industry standard, full-service platform)
- **AI**: Amazon Bedrock with separate models per use case
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with S3 for files
- **Infrastructure**: OpenTofu (Terraform-compatible, open source)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for logging and metrics

## Learning Insights

### Technical Learning

1. How to create comprehensive ADRs that capture both decisions and rationale
2. C4 model for architecture visualization at different levels
3. Importance of separating environments in open source projects
4. Trade-offs between different WebSocket implementations
5. Best practices for JWT storage (httpOnly cookies vs localStorage)
6. Infrastructure as Code patterns with OpenTofu
7. API design with Swagger/OpenAPI integration

### Process Learning

1. Importance of documenting "why" not just "what"
2. Value of templates for consistency
3. Need to track documentation debt
4. Iterative refinement of architectural decisions
5. Balance between planning and over-engineering

### Personal Growth

1. Developed clearer architectural thinking
2. Learned to question and validate design decisions
3. Improved at creating visual documentation
4. Better understanding of modern cloud architecture patterns
5. Gained confidence in making technology choices

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Documentation Scope Creep**: Started creating links to non-existent documents

- Solution: Created documentation tracker to manage debt

2. **Tooling Decisions**: Struggled with ADR format consistency

- Solution: Created robust template and updated all ADRs

3. **Level of Detail**: Balancing comprehensive documentation with practicality

- Solution: Focused on decisions that impact implementation

4. **Technology Choices**: Many options for each component

- Solution: Evaluated based on learning goals and project needs

## Next Steps

Based on our documentation tracker, the next priorities are:

1. Create Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
2. Document task processing flow
3. Document AI processing flow
4. Set up OpenTofu infrastructure
5. Design CI/CD pipeline

## Reflection

This session transformed SmartStack from a concept to a well-architected system. The project now has:

- Clear architectural boundaries
- Justified technology choices
- Comprehensive documentation
- A roadmap for implementation

The combination of ADRs and C4 diagrams provides both the "why" and the "how" of the system architecture. This foundation will make implementation much smoother and help maintain consistency as the project grows.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with Why**: Every technical decision should have a clear rationale
2. **Visual Documentation**: Diagrams make complex architectures understandable
3. **Iterative Design**: Architecture evolves through discussion and refinement
4. **Documentation Debt**: Track what needs to be created to avoid gaps
5. **Learning by Doing**: Building a real project accelerates learning

This architecture phase has created a solid foundation for SmartStack development. The next phase will transform these designs into working code.
